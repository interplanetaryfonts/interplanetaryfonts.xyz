# Interplanetary Fonts

A decentralized NFT marketplace for creators and collectors of Fonts.

## [ETHOnline 2022](https://online.ethglobal.com/) Hackathon Finalist Project üèÜ

Project page: https://ethglobal.com/showcase/interplanetary-fonts-ekwuo

<br><br>

## Project Description:

**Interplanetary Fonts** is a decentralized NFT platform where creators can share and collaborate on Font projects while receiving real-time payments by project-funders. Users of the platform can view, fund or mint any Font-NFT project deployed and decide whether to mint an entire charset or only a few characters, according to their needs.

## How it's made

The application is interacting with a smart contracts deployed on Polygon Mumbai testnet for NFT minting with IPFS and to fund projects/pay creators (using Superfluid streaming protocol). <br>
Users can connect with their wallet to the application, fund projects or mint NFTs, and can create new projects only by verifying with Worldcoin proof-of-personhood.
